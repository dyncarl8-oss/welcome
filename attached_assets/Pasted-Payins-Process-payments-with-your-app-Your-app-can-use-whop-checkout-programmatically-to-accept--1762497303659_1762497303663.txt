Payins
Process payments with your app

Your app can use whop checkout programmatically to accept payments via card, BNPL, ACH, crypto and all of whop’s supported payment methods.
There are three main ways to programmatically accept pay-ins.
Checkout links
Embedded checkout
In-App purchases
To initiate a checkout you need a plan, and optionally a checkout configuration.
Plans specify the price shown at checkout and type of purchase (either one_time or renewal) as well as many other configurable options. Plans can be created manually in the dashboard or via the api.
A checkout configuration allows you to attach custom metadata and redirect urls to one or more checkouts created from it. These can only be created via the api.
​
In App Purchases
Use in-app purchases to accept payments for one-time purchases or subscriptions directly within your app.
1
Create a checkout configuration

Use the API to create a checkout configuration. This will allow you to attach custom metadata about this specific purchase.
Do this on your server/backend, when the user selects the item / plan / option they want to purchase.
For the company_id argument, use the company id that your app is owned by. You can find this in the url of you app dashboard. It looks like biz_XXXXX.
In order to process payments on behalf of other companies, request the required permissions, and pass the company id of each respective company. For example you can derive this from the experience id provided in the experience view.

const checkoutConfiguration = whopsdk.checkoutConfigurations.create({
  	plan: {
  		company_id: "biz_XXXXXX",
  		initial_price: 10,
  		plan_type: "one_time",
  	},
  	metadata: {
  		item_id: "sword",
  		variant: "blue",
  	},
});
2
Open the in app purchase modal

Use the iframe SDK to trigger the in-app purchase modal in the client browser. This step only works inside the whop iframe in client side JS (experience, dashboard or discover view).

"use client";
import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

export default function PaymentButton() {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();

    const [paymentId, setPaymentId] = useState<string>();

    async function handlePurchase() {
        // 1. Create checkout configuration on server (from step one above)
        //    (in this example this is a nextjs server action, but it could also be a plain API route)
        const checkoutConfiguration = await createCheckoutConfiguration(/* can pass options here */);

        // 2. Open payment modal
        const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase({
            planId: checkoutConfiguration.plan.id,
            id: checkoutConfiguration.id
        });

        if (res.status === "ok") {
            setPaymentId(res.data.receipt_id);
        } else {
            // handle errors
        }
    }

    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Purchase</button>;
}

Setup payment webhooks

Webhooks are the most reliable way to be notified on your server about successful payments. We recommend using webhooks to unlock server gated content or fulfill payments.
If processing payments on your own company, you need to setup a company webhook to receive webhooks correctly.
Go to your developer dashboard Don’t select any app
Click “Create Webhook” in the top right.
Select API version v1
Select payment_succeeded
Copy your webhook key and prepare your SDK:

Typescript

Python

Ruby

Copy

import { Whop } from "@whop/sdk";

export const whopsdk = new Whop({
   	appID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
   	apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   	webhookKey: btoa(process.env.WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET || ""),
});
Processing payments on other companies

Verify the payment

After a payment is processed, you should validate it on your server using webhooks to ensure the payment was successful and update your application accordingly.
In your application framework, setup a webhook handler and fulfill purchases and/or update your database. We recommend handling webhooks in an async queue or waitUntil block to ensure the request handler responds quickly to avoid unnecessary webhook retries.

import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";
import type { Payment } from "@whop/sdk/resources.js";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { whopsdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

export async function POST(request: NextRequest): Promise<Response> {
   	// Validate the webhook to ensure it's from Whop
   	const requestBodyText = await request.text();
   	const headers = Object.fromEntries(request.headers);
   	const webhookData = whopsdk.webhooks.unwrap(requestBodyText, { headers });

   	// Handle the webhook event
   	if (webhookData.type === "payment.succeeded") {
  		waitUntil(handlePaymentSucceeded(webhookData.data));
   	}

   	// Make sure to return a 2xx status code quickly. Otherwise the webhook will be retried.
   	return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
}

async function handlePaymentSucceeded(invoice: Payment) {
   	// This is a placeholder for a potentially long running operation
   	// In a real scenario, you might need to fetch user data, update a database, etc.
   	console.log("[PAYMENT SUCCEEDED]", invoice);
}
You can also fetch payment data using the GET /api/v1/payments/:id api route which will return exactly the same data that is included in the webhook.
