# AutoWelcome AI - Complete Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

I've fixed all the major issues with your app:

### 1. **User Names Now Display Correctly** ‚úÖ
- Uses Whop SDK to fetch full user details
- Shows actual names (like "alleyah", "dujx3388") instead of just user IDs
- Works for both admins and customers
- Displays in header, dashboard, and customer views

### 2. **DM Sending Fixed** ‚úÖ
- Now uses the correct **GraphQL API** with `feedType: "dms_feed"`
- Sends personalized messages to new members
- Includes video link in the message
- Proper error handling and logging

### 3. **Webhook Signature Verification** ‚úÖ
- Properly validates all incoming webhooks using your secret
- Rejects invalid or missing signatures
- Prevents spoofed webhook attacks
- Detailed logging for debugging

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### When a New Member Joins:

1. **Whop sends webhook** ‚Üí Your app at `/api/whop/webhook`
2. **Signature verified** ‚Üí Using your webhook secret
3. **User details fetched** ‚Üí From Whop API (name, username, email)
4. **Customer record created** ‚Üí Stored in database
5. **Video generation triggered** ‚Üí HeyGen creates personalized video
6. **HeyGen webhook received** ‚Üí When video is ready
7. **DM sent automatically** ‚Üí User receives video in their Whop DMs

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Replit Secrets:

```
WHOP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=ws_4c187f951d819fb5c1a12f2b14dce2df5a3edaf3ef9be95ab1bf9428c9df6299
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_heygen_key_here
```

### Step 2: Configure Whop Webhook

1. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/
2. Select your app
3. Go to **Webhooks** section
4. Click **Add Webhook** or **Create Webhook**
5. Enter these details:
   - **URL**: `https://your-replit-app-url.replit.app/api/whop/webhook`
   - **Events**: Select `membership.went_valid`
   - **Secret**: `ws_4c187f951d819fb5c1a12f2b14dce2df5a3edaf3ef9be95ab1bf9428c9df6299`
6. Save and enable the webhook

### Step 3: Test the Webhook

Visit this URL to verify your webhook endpoint is accessible:
```
https://your-replit-app-url.replit.app/api/whop/webhook/test
```

You should see a JSON response confirming the endpoint is working.

### Step 4: Configure App in Whop

1. In your Whop app settings, set the **Experience View** path to:
   ```
   /experiences/[experienceId]
   ```

2. Make sure your app is installed in a Whop community/product

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Names Not Showing?

**Check the logs**: Look for these messages:
```
Fetched user details: {"name":"...","username":"..."}
User details: name="...", username="..."
```

If you see these, the names ARE being fetched. The issue is likely:
- Frontend not refreshing after login
- Using cached data
- Need to refresh the page

### Webhooks Not Receiving?

1. **Test the endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.replit.app/api/whop/webhook/test
   ```

2. **Check Whop Dashboard**:
   - Go to your webhook configuration
   - Look at "Recent Deliveries" or "Webhook Logs"
   - Verify the webhook is enabled

3. **Check for signature errors**:
   - Look for "Invalid Whop webhook signature" in logs
   - Verify your `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches what's in Whop dashboard

4. **Common issues**:
   - ‚úó Wrong webhook URL (must be `/api/whop/webhook`)
   - ‚úó Webhook secret doesn't match
   - ‚úó Wrong event selected (must be `membership.went_valid`)
   - ‚úó Webhook not enabled in Whop dashboard

### DMs Not Sending?

**Check the logs for**:
```
Attempting to send DM to user user_...
DM sent successfully to [name]
```

**If you see errors**:
- `GraphQL error: ...` ‚Üí Check your WHOP_API_KEY
- `feedId` errors ‚Üí Make sure using correct user ID
- 401/403 errors ‚Üí API key might be invalid

---

## üìä How to View Names

### Admin Dashboard
- Title now shows: **"Welcome, [Your Name]!"**
- Header displays your name next to the role badge
- Customer list shows full names (not just IDs)

### Customer View
- Welcome message: **"Welcome, [Your Name]!"**
- Shows personalized greeting
- Displays user ID below (for reference)

---

## üîç Debugging Tips

### 1. Check Logs
Look in your Replit console for:
- User fetch messages
- Webhook receipts
- DM sending confirmations
- Any error messages

### 2. Test Each Component

**Test User Fetch**:
```
POST /api/validate-access
Body: {"experienceId": "exp_xxx"}
Headers: x-whop-user-token: [your token]
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "hasAccess": true,
  "accessLevel": "admin",
  "userId": "user_xxx",
  "userName": "Your Name",
  "username": "your_username"
}
```

**Test Webhook**:
```
GET /api/whop/webhook/test
```

Should show environment status.

### 3. Common Log Messages

**‚úÖ Good**:
```
Fetched user details: {...}
User details: name="...", username="..."
Webhook - Fetched user details: {...}
New member joined: [name] (@username, user_id)
DM sent successfully to [name]
```

**‚ùå Bad**:
```
Error fetching user details
Invalid Whop webhook signature
GraphQL error: ...
Failed to send DM
```

2. Customer joins Whop ‚Üí Webhook received (shows in logs)
3. Customer record created ‚Üí Visible in admin customer list with full name
4. HeyGen video generates ‚Üí Shows "generating" status
5. Video completes ‚Üí HeyGen webhook received
6. DM sent ‚Üí Customer receives message in Whop DMs
7. Customer visits app ‚Üí Sees "Welcome, [Their Name]!" with instructions to check DMs

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If names still aren't showing or webhooks aren't working:

1. **Share your Replit logs** showing the validate-access and webhook calls
2. **Share screenshots** of your Whop webhook configuration
3. **Test the webhook test endpoint** and share the response
4. **Check Recent Deliveries** in Whop webhook settings

The app IS working correctly based on the logs - the names ARE being fetched and returned. The issue is likely with webhook configuration or frontend caching.
